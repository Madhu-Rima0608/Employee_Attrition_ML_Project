# Employee_Attrition_ML_Project
Employee Attrition Analysis using Machine Learning | People Analytics

## 📌 Problem

Employee attrition increases hiring costs, productivity loss, and organizational instability. This project builds a machine learning framework to identify attrition drivers and predict high-risk employees.

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze HR data and build predictive models to support proactive retention strategies.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Logistic Regression, Random Forest
EDA, Classification Modeling

## 📊 Dataset

IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset (~1,400 employees) including:

* Job role
* Satisfaction
* Overtime
* Income
* Tenure
* Demographics

## 🔍 Methodology

* Data cleaning and feature selection
* Categorical encoding
* Exploratory data analysis
* Logistic Regression (baseline interpretable model)
* Random Forest (non-linear predictive model)
* Confusion matrix evaluation
* Feature importance analysis

## 🤖 Modeling Tradeoff

Logistic Regression used for interpretability
Random Forest used for predictive strength
Balanced explainability with performance.

## 📈 Key Insights

* Overtime strongly increases attrition likelihood
* Low job satisfaction correlates with exits
* Income and tenure are major predictors
* Behavioral features outperform demographic ones

## 🏢 Business Impact

Enables early identification of high-risk employees and supports data-driven HR retention planning.
